### Assignment 13 (06/30)
**Call By Value, Call By Reference, Returning Objects and Recursion**
1. Create a class Employee,
	* With age, salaryPerDay and noOfDaysWorking attributes
	* A method to compute monthly salary, which will return the monthly salary which is calculated as salaryPerDay*noOfDaysWorking

	* Create multiple employees with the following data. (Values are comma separated - first value is age, second is salaryPerDay, third is noOfDaysWorking)
		*  employee1 - (26, 1000, 27)
		*  employee2 - (39, 1250, 25)
		*  employee3 - (41, 1100, 29)
		*  employee4 - (53, 1050, 26)
		*  employee5 - (62, 1150, 24)

### Assignment 9 (06/26)
**Common Programs asked during interviews**
1. Find out if a number is prime or not using Java.
2. Print the Fibonaaci series using Java upto a given number.
3. Swap two variables without using a temporary variable. (Hint : Use bitwise operators)



### Assignment 8 (06/23)
**Arrays In Java, Try few programs**
1. Go through the arrays lecture, notes and programs.
2. Write a program to check if two arrays are equal or not. Eg 1: array1  = {2,3,4,5} , array2 = {2,3,4,5} , output should be true. Eg 2: array1  = {2,3,4,6} , array2 = {2,3,4,5} , output should be false.
3. Write a program to find the sum of numbers at even and odd indices in array and then print out the which sum is the greatest.
	* Eg: array = {4,5,2,8,3,6}
	* Sum at even indices = 4+2+3 = 9 (4 is at index 0, 2 is at index 2, 3 is at index 4)
	* Sum at odd  indices = 5+8+6 = 19 (5 is at index 1, 8 is at index 3, 6 is at index 5)
	* O/p should be: Sum at odd indices is greatest.

### Assignment 7 (06/22)
**Iteration Statements - for, while, do while**
1. Go through all the Iteration Statements discussed in the class
2. Write a program to calculate factorial of a number using while loop.
3. Write a program to print only the even numbers from 1 to 100.

### Assignment 6 (06/21)

1. Go through all the Selection Statements discussed in the class
2. Write a program using switch statement to print day of the week
3. Write the above program using if else ladder


### Assignment 5 (06/20)
**Arithmetic,BitWise ,Relational ,Boolean Logical ,Ternary Operators**
